We won 3-1 but Thomas Frank says they destroyed us Disappointed face
Thomas Frank mocking Sancho for being worth £72m and not being in this squad is very distasteful considering he was at a family funeral.
Thomas Frank mocking Sancho for being worth £72m and not being in this squad is very distasteful considering he was at a family funeral.
Think we can all agree Thomas Frank has shown himself to be a scumbag tonight, actually had a form of respect for him too
Brentford's manager Thomas Frank was all of us when Cristiano was subbed. Upside-down face
Jadon Sancho had very public bereavement issues and missed the game today and Thomas Frank came out and slated him? 
Think someone should let Thomas Frank know why Jadon Sancho wasn't playing tonight, not that it concerns the manager of Brentford. Man facepalming
Think someone should let Thomas Frank know why Jadon Sancho wasn't playing tonight, not that it concerns the manager of Brentford. Man facepalming
Was gonna say I almost feel bad for Brentford, but Thomas Frank sounds like a little bitch and chews gum like he thinks he’s Fergie so nah, fuck ‘em
We’ve ruined Thomas Frank’s night and he’s still got greasy hair and looks like he’s got 6 people buried in his back garden, beautiful stuff
Sancho not being in the squad because he went to a funeral but Thomas Frank names him in his post match rant
Jadon Sancho was at a family funeral today & Thomas Frank has inexplicably decided that he was at fault for his team getting beaten 3-1 at home...
Warning to all big clubs going to play Brentford the smallest club in the Premier League 
Thomas Frank is quite obviously frustrated with not winning tonight and taking it out on us even if there’s truth behind what he’s saying. Brentford played well especially in the first half and created good opportunities which DDG was able to deal with. They should be proud.
Brentford manager Thomas Frank: “We are flattered to be linked with Christian Eriksen, he absolutely deserves to play at top level. And no, I’ve not spoken to Christian at the moment”. 
Thomas Frank: "We are the smallest club in the Premier League, Manchester United the biggest, we destroyed them in the first half, they didn't have a sniff. The way we smashed them in the first half was fantastic, so proud of my team."
Thomas Frank sounds like the kind of guy who rubs his wife’s thigh instead of her Cat face with wry smile for 45 minutes straight and then gets mad at her for not finishing
It doesn't matter whether Thomas Frank knew Sancho's reason for not playing. You don't take out your frustration of losing a game on a 21 year old.
I used to like Thomas Frank and considered him a decent chap.
‘I don’t care to be honest. We won the match, he can talk as much as he wants but the more he does, the more salt comes out of his mouth. I will go to his house and make sure he has enough salt. What a prick he is’
‘I don’t care to be honest. We won the match, he can talk as much as he wants but the more he does, the more salt comes out of his mouth. I will go to his house and make sure he has enough salt. What a prick he is’
Thomas Frank: "Of the three goals, the second is most disappointing and difficult to come back from. The way we smashed them [#mufc] in the first half was fantastic, so proud of my team." #mulive [bt]
Thomas Frank: "One of those nights, fair play to David de Gea, if we get those chances again one will go in the back of the net. Our intensity killed them, we showed that in the first half, we played the Brentford way." #mulive [bt]
Thomas Frank, I liked you. Now you are dead to me. Douchebag! What’s Sancho got to do with this?"
We absolutely destroyed Man United first half. It's a miracle they were not 2-0 down at half-time, De Gea did a fine job, by far the best Man United player."
Thomas Frank has gone from pissing off fans of Championship clubs to fans of Manchester United. Inject it Syringe
Thomas Frank has made himself look like a right salty prick in that post match interviewFace with tears of joy
Thomas Frank mentioning Jadon Sancho’s price is all a bit irrelevant and silly in any case when the three goals against them were scored by players from the Manchester United academy.
TREASURE - ‘THE SECOND STEP : CHAPTER ONE’ CONCEPT POSTER BONUS CUT <HARUTO>
Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick makes "leader" claim about Scott McTominay #mufc
Ralf: ‘This is Harry Maguire farewell game, so I had to give him 15 mins. Hope u understand’ Face with tears of joy #BREMUN 
People hate Fred and Mctominay for not being good enough on the ball but want Zakaria and Haidara to come and play instead of them. Shiny new toy syndrome is dangerous
De Gea MOTM for me. Bruno and McTominay good second half. Varane underrated superb too and Lindelof
Eventually when you all stop it with your agendas you'll see that Scott McTominay is actually a very good midfielder.
McTominay is class and I LOVE that I backed him from the start, but if you wanna join the train, hop on its not too late Star-struck
 Scott McTominay has won the WhoScored Man of the Match award in three of Ralf Rangnick's first nine matches in charge of Manchester United, more than any other player
By the way, I thought Scott McTominay was very good in that No.6 role tonight.
McTominay has been asked to play a new deeper role and he's done it so well this game. That pass was incredible too. Gets too much hate for giving his all. Proper player.
McTominay fought teeth and nail to win that ball, dogged his way through two players to go on that run, set up Bruno with a superb pass and that lead to the goal.
He's been unbelievable today and has been one of the stand out performers this season. Proper proper player.
Mctominay winning ball,leaving press for dead with close control & then driving out with power is never not going to be a sight to behold.That's 3 highly rated attributes of the modern midfield game he's aced there. It was a breathtaking little sequence.The 3rdgoal is all him tbh
It was a good day for the Academy boys today. Rashford, Elanga, and Greenwood all scored. McTominay was immense.

Rangnick on #mufc's game against West Ham: "Big. We have to win the game on Saturday, they have not played during the week, only have three days and it would be helpful to have players that were not available today." #mulive [bbc]
Personally do not care in the slightest how much West Ham spend in a transfer window. Wether it’s £300m or £3m, I just want to see the squad being improved with the players Moyes wants.
Our academy midfielder Halle Houssein came off the bench to score on her debut for West Ham. Assisted by Lisa Evans. Clapping hands signClapping hands sign
Decent win for MUFC at Brentford. Poor against a well drilled side in first half, far better in second with three goals. Still seventh, but two points behind Sat's opponents West Ham who are fourth - and with game in hand. McTominay, Dalot and De Gea among best players.
Decent win for MUFC at Brentford. Poor against a well drilled side in first half, far better in second with three goals. Still seventh, but two points behind Sat's opponents West Ham who are fourth - and with game in hand. McTominay, Dalot and De Gea among best players.
Rangnick said when he took over from Carrick it was wrong to change a winning side so he stuck with Carrick's side that beat Arsenal. He has to stick with the same team against West Ham from tonight.
Without De Gea we lose tonight. But second half was much better and West Ham becomes huge now. Simply have to win. Although if we don't buy a CDM I still think top 4 is impossible
Another reminder is that we have lost only 4 games all season, twice to Man City, away to Juventus & West Ham. We only lost by the odd goal in all 4 of those games. Our problem is that we have drawn to many games. Our attacking players is what is letting us down in my opinion.
He has also been offered to West Ham and his agent is expected in Italy in the next few days for various meetings with Serie A clubs.
 Rangnick on the next game vs West Ham: “Big. We have to win the game on Saturday, they have not played during the week, only have three days and it would be helpful to have players that were not available today.” [BBC]
20th January 1973, Big Jim and Little Lou, both made their United debuts in the 2-2 draw with West Ham at Old Trafford. Lou made a goal scoring start in a red shirt. The Docs revolution was underway. It was to be anything but a smooth road, but what a team it turned out to be.
Harder dinks a great ball over the top of the West Ham back-line and Fleming is just whiskers away from making contact with it.
Only West Ham could beat Man City, Liverpool Chelsea and Tottenham at home but lose to Leeds,Southampton and Brentford aswell lmaoI do love West Ham.
Big game for Saïd Benrahma & Algeria today! If Algeria do not win today against Ivory Coast, they will be out of AFCON.

Lots being said about Jesse Lingard. "He should have left in the summer" or "he should go back to West Ham." United never put a proposal to him to go last summer. Not once. This month, Spurs and West Ham have had approaches rejected because United are worried about the top four.
West Ham, Everton, Newcastle and Leicester City are interested in bringing Malang Sarr in on loan but #Chelsea are not planning to let him leave this window.
West Ham, Chelsea and City are the only 3 teams in the PL to have played all their games. To be 4th without the squad depth that City and Chelsea have, causing us to be knackered from playing all our games, is pretty impressive
BREAKING:West Ham had an approach for Jesse Lingard rejected this month because United are worried about the top four.

Does anyone else just not give a shit about transfer news right now? Each window I become less and less interested and just take no notice until I see them holding the shirt
 Rangnick on Aaron Wan-Bissaka: “He’s still ill, I’m afraid. He will not be available for the game tomorrow [vs Brentford] and also probably not available for the West Ham game. Hopefully, after the international break, he will be back for training.” [MU]
For any younger West Ham fans, don’t believe anything don’t listen to any rumours. Until you see the player holding up the shirt
 signed as a schoolboy in 1985, 2 years later signed as an apprentice, 2 years later signed pro, debut at 19 at West Ham, 4 years as a pro left for PNE, came back coached U15s for a year then 1996 kitman with my mate Gordon Guthrie, still thereRam

Anthony Elanga reflects on another impressive performance and his first goal of the season.
Hate it or love it, La Carrington is on top. It’s been tough up in Manny but the club’s young ballers ran it up for the cause. Goals for Anthony Elanga, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford secured a win and restored a feeling made in Manchester.
"To play with a great player like Ronaldo is an honour, you just have to enjoy it every game and in training."
"To play with a great player like Ronaldo is an honour, you just have to enjoy it every game and in training."
Anthony Elanga won’t be losing his first team spot any time soon. He’s one of the shining lights at the moment & already proving he can be a difference maker at this level. Him scoring that first goal at a crucial time was the turning point in this game.
Anthony Elanga is a better winger than Vinicius Junior. What a goal, fantastic!!!!!
